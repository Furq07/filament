# Simple and complex decorations

## This section is outdated, as of filament 0.5.0 all decorations are considered "complex"

All decorations with behaviours or blocks larger that a single block are considered to be "complex".

Complex decorations are not be pushable by pistons and have slighty higher performance impact on the server due to the flexible nature and multiblock-structure support.
